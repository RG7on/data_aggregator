# Workers Directory
# ================
# Place your worker modules in this folder.
# Each worker file should:
# 1. Define a Worker class that inherits from BaseWorker
# 2. Implement the scrape() method
# 3. Return a dictionary of KPIs
#
# Files starting with underscore (_) are ignored by the driver.
# See _example_worker.py for a template.
